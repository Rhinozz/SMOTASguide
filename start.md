# Super Mario Odyssey TASing Guide

## What is a TAS?

A tool-assisted-speedrunning (TAS) is a speedrun in which a machine plays back a list of controller inputs to create perfect gameplay for a speedgame.

It is usually done through an emulator, but the Nintendo Switch has no emulator with accurate TAS playback. Instead, it is done through a hacked console, custom firmware, and software made by the community to TAS.

## What is Custom Firmware!

Custom firmware (CFW) is unauthorized software installed on the Switch that modifies the operating system. A common example is Atmosphere, which patches the OS as actions are inputted.

It allows for more control over what can be done on the console, from unlocking internal settings to installing Android or Linux. For this guide, we will sit in the middle with modding games on the system.

## What do I need to know?

- Throughout this guide, you should keep your device charged. Dying during important processes can cause data corruption or system damage.
- It is advised you read the guide before starting the TASing process.
